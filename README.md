This is a description on how to create a HTML page containing a list of publications from a bibteX file, to get something like this one. It uses the reference manager JabRef, which is a nice tool to have anyway if you are using bibteX. PubListX is heavily inspired from PubList with eXtended features.

## Installation

- Download then extract and copy all files in the PubListX distribution to a directory.
- Open JabRef and select menu Options | Manage Custom Exports.
- In the opened dialog box, click Add new to create a new export. Enter PubListX as the export name and .html as the file extension. Click Browse and select file publistx.layout in the PubListX directory as the main layout file.
- Click OK then Close to complete. When you select menu File | Export, PubListX should be now in the list of available exports.

## Usage

PubListX exports a list of bibliography items from JabRef to raw HTML code. The generated HTML file cannot be dislayed directly but needs to be embedded in other HTML files. If your HTML files are generated by a text-to-html tool, e.g. Jemdoc, you can include the HTML publication list file in your source file as raw HTML code.

***Export a publication list from JabRef***

- Open JabRef then select menu File | Export to export all items in your library. If you want to export selected items instead, highlight them in the main window and select menu File | Export selected entries.
- In the export dialog, select PubListX as the file format, specify a file name then click Save. A new file should be created containing the HTML code for the publication list.

***Embed a PubListX file in Jemdoc***

To produce the list in an HTML file named bib.html generated by PubListX, create a new jemdoc document (or edit an existing one) and add the command:
```
#includeraw{bib.html}
```
at the place where the list should appear. In the header of the jemdoc file, add the CSS file bibtex.css as following:
```
# jemdoc: addcss{bibtex.css}
```
Jemdoc must be called with the configuration file bibtex.conf, as follows:
```
python jemdoc.py -c bibtex.conf -o <output folder> <jemdoc filename>.jemdoc
```
***Include additional materials for a publication***

In many cases, links to files need to be included after each publication, for example the pdf file of the paper, the slide file of the talk or a Github repository containing computer code. These links can be created automatically using a custom field named pdf, slide or code in the bibtex code of a publication. In the output HTML, the code and pdf fields in the display bibtex entry have been eliminated while their links appear beside the bibtex link.
